Read arguments from command line and print it out. Prompt the user to

1. Enter a number
2. Enter a string
3. Enter a double

Assign these values to the appropriate data types ie a number should be assigned to an int, a double should be assigned to a double  

Print the values you have read.

Hint: If you are using Java, use the built-in Scanner class.

Why: Helps build familarity with handling command line arguments. Also, command line to this date remains the fastest way  
to automate things as you dont need to build an elaborate user interface. For ex, you could write a command line program
that asks the user for his credentials and pays his bills by invoking the appropriate web services.
