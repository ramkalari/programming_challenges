This exercise will 
1.Help you gain further practice on arithmetic, use of variables and string concatenation
2. Depending on the approach you take, this may also be your first introduction to the built-in libraries of your programming language

The diameter of the Sun is approximately 865,400 miles. The diameter of the Earth is
approximately 7917.5 miles.  Calculate,
(a) the volume of the Earth in cubic miles
(b) the volume of the Sun in cubic miles
(c) the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth
and then output the three values. Treat both the earth and sun as spheres. The volume of a
sphere is given by the formula 4 pi r^3/3 where r is the radius.

The
output should say something like: 
The volume of the Earth is X cubic miles, the volume of the
sun is Y cubic miles, and the ratio of the volume of the Sun to the volume of the Earth is Z. 

Fun Fact: If you did this right, you will realise that you could pack close to 1.3 million earths in a Sun. Adding further insult to injury, the Sun
is just average in terms of size compared to the other stars in the universe.
