 A Linked List is a data structure with each node containing 2 elements, the data  
and a pointer to a next node. The last element of a linked list does not point to anything ie the next pointer will be null.

For ex, this is a linked list of integers 1 -> 2 - >3



A linked list can be represented as follows

class Node{  
   int data;
   Node next
}

The first node is called the head of the linked list. For the case above, the first Node will have its data as 1 and next
pointing to the second Node object.

The second Node Object will have data as 2 and next pointing to 3rd node object.

The 3rd node object will have data as 3 and next will be null.

Your task will be to   
1. construct a linked list 
2. write a function Print(Node n) that accepts the head node as the argument, traverses all the nodes and prints the contents.

Expected Output
1. For the linked List 1->2-3, the expected output of Print(Node n) is
1
2
3

2. If the head node itself is null, then nothing should be printed.


Expected Time: 5 min to 15 minutes
Why: Serves as a basic introduction to data structures, also can be a good intro to recursion depending on how you choose 
to solve this
