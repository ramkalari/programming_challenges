Given a square matrix of size , calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals. For example, if the given  
matrix is  
1 2 7
4 5 6
7 9 10

the primary diagonal has the elements 1, 5 and 10 whose sum in 16
the secondary diagonal has the elements 7, 5, and 7 whose sum is 19

the absolute difference is |16 - 19| = 3.

This program will help introduce you to multidimensional arrays, or list of lists and nested loops.

Expected Output: The diagonal difference is 3

Expected Time to Solve: 2 hours
