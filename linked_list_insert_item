Create a Linked List and insert a node at the end of the list and return the head of the linked list. Note - Try not to use the built-in linked list. Create your own  
implementation of LinkedList.

A simple implementation in Java would be

class Node{
Node next;
int data;
}

You should implement a method 

Node insert(Node head, int data){
}

Test Cases;
1. If head is null, it should return a single node linked list with the given data and next pointing to null.  
2. If head is not null, say it is the head of a  linked list 1->4>-3 and you want to insert 5. the output should be 1->4->3->2.  

Why?
1. More familiarity working with linked list  
2. More familiarity with recursion
